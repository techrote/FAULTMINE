# FAULTMINE

FAULTMINE is a standalone Windows glitch-art synthesis instrument built around **controlled, deterministic mistakes** rather than a conventional filter stack.

The program deliberately misinterprets image memory, addressing, representation, bitplanes, channels, timing, reconstruction and feedback. Every result must remain reproducible from its source identity, genome, seed and engine version.

The core interaction is evolutionary exploration: generate a tray of related glitch specimens, select interesting results, lock desirable genes, mutate the rest, breed compatible genomes and progressively reduce mutation radius to excavate a visual neighbourhood.

## Product principles

- **Reproducibility is a contract.** A saved genome is evidence sufficient to reconstruct the same canonical result.
- **Faults are simulated safely.** Artistic memory corruption must never rely on C/C++ undefined behaviour or unsafe host memory access.
- **The CPU reference engine is authoritative.** GPU rendering may accelerate presentation, but must not silently change canonical output.
- **Standalone means standalone.** v1 targets Windows x64 using C++20, Win32, D3D11/DXGI and WIC, with no required package manager, web runtime or external application framework.
- **Exploration beats presets.** Seeds, mutation, locks, crossover and lineage are first-class concepts.
- **Projects stay inspectable.** State is stored in versioned human-readable files with explicit source/provenance metadata.
- **Fast path to usefulness.** The roadmap establishes a usable end-to-end still-image glitch workflow before expanding the fault catalogue.

## Authoritative development documentation

Start with [`docs/RAG_INDEX.md`](docs/RAG_INDEX.md). It indexes the product, architecture, roadmap, verification and autonomous-issue execution contracts.

Implementation work is tracked as GitHub issues prefixed `FM-###`. Each implementation issue is intended to be executable autonomously: inspect current `main`, implement the stated scope, test it, reconcile documentation, open a PR, repair CI, merge after required checks pass, verify the merge landed on `main`, and only then close the issue when its acceptance criteria are satisfied.

## Planned stack

- C++20
- CMake + MSVC
- Win32 desktop shell
- D3D11 / DXGI presentation
- Windows Imaging Component (WIC) image I/O
- Windows built-in crypto primitives where useful for content identity
- GitHub Actions on `windows-latest`

No third-party runtime dependency is part of the baseline design. Any future dependency must be justified against the standalone/distributable requirement and documented before adoption.
